        <p>Cats are jerks. They do whatever they want whenever they want. Put a cup at the edge of a table, and they will knock it down!</p>
        <p>Cats are liquid. If their head can fit, they could squeeze through it. Want cat bread? Put a cat in there, and it will transform into cat bread!</p> 
        <p>Cats are adorable.  They snuggle, they purr, and they communicate with body language!</p>
